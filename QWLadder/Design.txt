Try to remember login and password - none found - show login page
Try to login automatically to IRC - no success - show alert, and show login page
when login is executed, two things are saved:
* checkbox "login auto"
* login/pass info

Podcast idea: "Checking in on Quakeworld"
(maybe a more flattering title?)

E-Mailed johnny_cz and pleuraxeraphim to get access to stats.qwnu


To make a claim to the ownership of your online handle,
use an IRC bot

Possible registry entries to use (and verify they exist on disk)
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\qw\Definition\Default
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\qw\shell\Open\Command\Default

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\qw\DefaultIcon\Default
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\qw\shell\Open\Command\Default

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Compatibility Assistant\Store <search for Name = *ezquake*>

Enter your username:
Please note, your username is forced to be either
a) your real life IRC handle on irc.quakenet.org
or b) your primary E-Mail address.
Note: if you don't want to reveal your E-Mail, simply register a username on irc.quakenet.org and use that!  Be sure to hang out in #qwrookie for any questions.

Add ability to interface with an online database hosted via json/rest

Database consists of:

ladder name,
player,
queue time,
queue status (open, currently playing, history)
game result and stats (only if history)


Also need a system to.  Every time a ladder queue is issued:
a) Retrieve most up to date list of servers
b) Calculate ping times to each server

update the central database as follows:
delete from pingtimes where player = thisuser

delete from serverlist
grap rss feed of quakeservers and
insert into serverlist

select ip, port, servername from serverlist
foreach server
insert into 

c) Waiting for players

Then if there are other players (per ladder), show them as the following query:
select
  l1.ladder name, l1.player, l2.player
from ladder l1
join ladder l2 on l1.ladder name = l2.ladder name
and l1.player <> l2.player

group by ladder name

best server for each ladder's player A - player B match up is as follows:
ladder, player1, player2, ping to server


As the process is launched, be sure to what?
