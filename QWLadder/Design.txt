Podcast idea: "Checking in on Quakeworld"
(maybe a more flattering title?)

E-Mailed johnny_cz and pleuraxeraphim to get access to stats.qwnu

***
Add ability to interface with an online database hosted via json/rest

Database consists of:

rails generate scaffold User name:string email:string
rails generate scaffold Ladder ladder:string player:string status:string result:string
rails generate scaffold Server server:string port:integer name:string description:string
rails generate scaffold Ping server:string player:string ping:integer
bundle exec rake db:migrate

ladder name,
player,
queue time, (rails generates automatically)
queue status (open, currently playing, history)
game result and stats (only if history)


Also need a system to.  Every time a ladder queue is issued:
a) Retrieve most up to date list of servers
b) Calculate ping times to each server

update the central database as follows:
delete from pingtimes where player = thisuser

delete from serverlist
grap rss feed of quakeservers and
insert into serverlist

select ip, port, servername from serverlist
foreach server
insert into 

c) Waiting for players

Then if there are other players (per ladder), show them as the following query:
select
  l1.ladder name, l1.player, l2.player
from ladder l1
join ladder l2 on l1.ladder name = l2.ladder name
and l1.player <> l2.player

group by ladder name

best server for each ladder's player A - player B match up is as follows:
ladder, player1, player2, ping to server


As the process is launched, be sure to what?
